QUESTION 2

Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. This means that when a signal is triggered, the receiver function executes in the same thread as the code that triggered the signal.

code:
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
import threading

# Signal receiver function
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_created_signal(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Django view to create a new user
def create_user_view(request):
    print(f"Creating user in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
    User.objects.create(username="new_user")
    return HttpResponse("User created")

When you trigger the create_user_view

Creating user in thread: MainThread
Signal received in thread: MainThread

This output shows that both the view and the signal handler run in the same thread, confirming that Django signals operate the same thread as the caller.
